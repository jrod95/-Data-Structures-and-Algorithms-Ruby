Quicksort involves implementing the following two methods:
  1.) Partition
    - Selects item from a list called a pivot.
    - List is rearranged leaving items less than pivot to
      the left and greater to the right.
    - Returns p_index
  2.) Quicksort Method
    - Applies recursive calls to right and left half of
    array until each half only has one element.
